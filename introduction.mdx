# Welcome to OpenClaw

OpenClaw is a **personal AI assistant** you run on your own devices. It acts as a central gateway that connects AI agents to all your messaging platforms—WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, and more.

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw provides a **local-first Gateway** that serves as a single control plane for:

- **Multi-channel messaging**: Connect to WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, iMessage, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, and more
- **AI agent integration**: Built-in Pi agent runtime with RPC mode, tool streaming, and block streaming
- **Session management**: Per-sender sessions with group isolation and activation modes
- **Security by default**: DM pairing, allowlists, and sandbox isolation for group chats
- **Multi-platform support**: macOS menu bar app, iOS/Android nodes, and web control UI

If you want a personal, single-user assistant that feels local, fast, and always-on, this is it.

```

The Gateway runs as a WebSocket server (default port 18789) on your local machine or VPS. All messaging channels connect through the Gateway, which routes messages to the appropriate AI agent based on your configuration.
