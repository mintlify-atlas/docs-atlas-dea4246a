# macOS App

The OpenClaw macOS app is a **menubar companion** that manages the Gateway, handles permissions, and exposes macOS capabilities as a node.

## Features

- **Menu bar integration**: Native notifications and status indicator
- **Bundled Gateway**: Runs the Gateway locally via LaunchAgent or connects to remote instances
- **Voice wake**: Hands-free "Hey OpenClaw" activation with local speech recognition
- **Canvas**: WebView-based UI automation and screen rendering
- **System integration**: Camera, screen recording, AppleScript automation
- **Permission management**: Handles all TCC prompts (Notifications, Accessibility, Screen Recording, Microphone, Speech Recognition)
- **Remote mode**: Connect to remote Gateway over SSH/Tailscale while exposing local node capabilities

## Installation

### Download from releases

1. Download `OpenClaw-YYYY.M.D.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases)
2. Extract and move `OpenClaw.app` to `/Applications`
3. Launch the app (right-click → Open on first launch to bypass Gatekeeper)
4. Complete the permissions checklist when prompted

### Build from source

Requirements:
- Xcode 16+
- Node.js 22+
- pnpm

```bash
# From repository root
pnpm install

# Package the app (creates dist/OpenClaw.app)
scripts/package-mac-app.sh

# Or quick dev run (fastest, ad-hoc signing)
scripts/restart-mac.sh --no-sign
```

Dev run options:
- `--no-sign`: Fastest dev mode with ad-hoc signing (TCC permissions don't persist)
- `--sign`: Force code signing with available certificate

For development workflow details, see [macOS dev setup](/platforms/mac/dev-setup).

## Gateway modes

### Local mode (default)

The app manages a local Gateway via LaunchAgent:
- Label: `bot.molt.gateway` (or `bot.molt.<profile>` when using profiles)
- The app enables the service via `openclaw gateway install` if not present
- Start/stop/restart via app menu or:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/bot.molt.gateway
launchctl bootout gui/$UID/bot.molt.gateway
```

### Remote mode

Connect to a remote Gateway over SSH/Tailscale:
- The app connects to remote Gateway WebSocket
- Local **node host service** runs to expose macOS capabilities to remote Gateway
- SSH tunnel handles WebSocket port forwarding (default 18789)
- Voice wake commands forward to remote Gateway

See [macOS remote access](/platforms/mac/remote) for setup details.

## Voice wake

"Hey OpenClaw" hands-free activation:
- Uses on-device speech recognition (no network required)
- Configurable wake words and forwarding patterns
- Commands forwarded to CLI: `openclaw-mac agent --message "${text}" --thinking low`
- Replies delivered to last active channel (WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord/WebChat)

Configuration in Settings → Voice Wake:
- Enable/disable wake detection
- Customize wake word phrases
- Set command forwarding template
- Test wake detection

See [macOS Voice Wake](/platforms/mac/voicewake) for implementation details.

## Canvas support

The macOS app exposes Canvas via WKWebView:
- Commands: `canvas.present`, `canvas.navigate`, `canvas.eval`, `canvas.snapshot`, `canvas.a2ui.*`
- Serves content from Gateway at `http://localhost:18789/__openclaw__/canvas/`
- Supports A2UI (agent-to-UI) protocol for dynamic interfaces
- Live reload when workspace files change

Example:
```bash
# Navigate to canvas workspace
openclaw nodes invoke --node "mac" --command canvas.navigate --params '{"url":"http://localhost:18789/__openclaw__/canvas/"}'

# Evaluate JavaScript
openclaw nodes invoke --node "mac" --command canvas.eval --params '{"javaScript":"document.body.style.background='blue'"}'

# Take snapshot
openclaw nodes invoke --node "mac" --command canvas.snapshot --params '{"format":"jpeg","maxWidth":1200}'
```

See [macOS Canvas](/platforms/mac/canvas) for full API.

## Node capabilities

The macOS app registers as a node with these commands:

- **Canvas**: `canvas.present`, `canvas.navigate`, `canvas.eval`, `canvas.snapshot`, `canvas.a2ui.*`
- **Camera**: `camera.snap`, `camera.clip`
- **Screen**: `screen.record`
- **System**: `system.run` (controlled by exec approvals), `system.notify`

The node reports a `permissions` map so agents can check what's allowed before invoking.

## Permissions

Required TCC permissions:
- **Notifications**: For agent alerts and responses
- **Accessibility**: For `system.run` AppleScript automation
- **Screen Recording**: For screen capture and Canvas screenshots
- **Microphone**: For voice wake and talk mode
- **Speech Recognition**: For voice wake processing

The app Settings shows permission status and provides direct links to System Settings.

See [macOS Permissions](/platforms/mac/permissions) for troubleshooting.

## Exec approvals (system.run)

`system.run` is gated by **Exec approvals** (Settings → Exec approvals):

- **Security modes**: `deny`, `allowlist`, `ask`, `allow`
- **Ask policy**: `never`, `on-miss`, `always`
- **Allowlist**: Glob patterns for approved binary paths
- Stored locally: `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`

Example config:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "defaults": {
    "security": "deny",
    "ask": "on-miss"
  },
  "agents": {
    "main": {
      "security": "allowlist",
      "ask": "on-miss",
      "allowlist": [{"pattern": "/opt/homebrew/bin/*"}]
    }
  }
}
```

When a prompt appears, choosing "Always Allow" adds the command to the allowlist.

## Deep links

The app registers `openclaw://` URL scheme:

### `openclaw://agent`

Trigger agent requests from anywhere:

```bash
open 'openclaw://agent?message=What%20is%20the%20weather'
```

Query parameters:
- `message` (required): The message to send
- `sessionKey` (optional): Target session
- `thinking` (optional): Thinking level
- `deliver`/`to`/`channel` (optional): Delivery target
- `key` (optional): Unattended mode key (skips confirmation prompt)

Safety:
- Without `key`: Prompts for confirmation and limits message length
- With valid `key`: Runs unattended (for personal automations)

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway won't start

1. Check LaunchAgent status:
```bash
launchctl print gui/$UID/bot.molt.gateway
```

2. View logs:
```bash
./scripts/clawlog.sh --last 5m
```

3. Reinstall service:
```bash
openclaw gateway install
```

### Voice wake not working

1. Verify permissions: Settings → Privacy & Security → Speech Recognition
2. Enable "Discovery Debug Logs" in app Settings → Voice Wake
3. Check logs for wake detection events:
```bash
./scripts/clawlog.sh --category VoiceWake --last 10m
```

### Canvas commands fail

1. Ensure Canvas window is visible (bring to front)
2. Check Screen Recording permission
3. Verify Gateway canvas host is configured:
```bash
openclaw config get gateway.canvasHost
```

### Remote mode connection issues

1. Test SSH connectivity:
```bash
ssh user@gateway-host 'echo ok'
```

2. Verify Gateway is listening:
```bash
ssh user@gateway-host 'ss -ltnp | grep 18789'
```

3. Check tunnel status in app Settings → Gateway → Connection Status

See [macOS troubleshooting](/platforms/mac/health) for more diagnostics.
