description: Connect OpenClaw to Signal using signal-cli with phone number registration
---

Signal integration requires [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli), a command-line interface for Signal. This provides end-to-end encrypted messaging with full support for DMs, groups, reactions, and media.

## Prerequisites

- A dedicated phone number for the bot (cannot be your personal Signal number)
- signal-cli installed on your system
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 17 or newer

<Warning>
  You cannot use your personal Signal number with signal-cli. You need a separate phone number that is not already registered with Signal.
</Warning>

## Quick Start

The interactive onboarding can guide you through Signal setup:

```bash
openclaw init
```

Select Signal and follow the prompts.

## Installing signal-cli

### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install signal-cli
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
# Add repository
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/signal-cli.gpg] https://updates.signal.org/linux/apt xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/signal-cli.list'

# Add signing key
wget -O- https://updates.signal.org/linux/signing-key.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/signal-cli.gpg > /dev/null

# Install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install signal-cli
```

### From Binary

1. Download the latest release from [signal-cli releases](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/releases)
2. Extract: `tar xf signal-cli-*.tar.gz`
3. Add to PATH or use full path in config

### Verify Installation

```bash
signal-cli --version
```

You should see output like: `signal-cli 0.11.12`

## Registering a Signal Number

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register your number">
    Replace `+15555550123` with your bot's phone number (E.164 format):

    ```bash
    signal-cli -a +15555550123 register
    ```

    You'll receive an SMS with a verification code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify with code">
    Enter the verification code you received:

    ```bash
    signal-cli -a +15555550123 verify 123-456
    ```

    (Replace `123-456` with the actual code)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the connection">
    Send a test message to yourself:

    ```bash
    signal-cli -a +15555550123 send -m "Test message" +15555550123
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Linking as a Secondary Device (Alternative)

If you prefer to link signal-cli as a secondary device:

```bash
signal-cli link -n "OpenClaw"
```

This will display a QR code. Scan it with Signal on your phone:
1. Open Signal → Settings → Linked Devices
2. Tap "+" to add a device
3. Scan the QR code

After linking, get your registered number:

```bash
signal-cli listAccounts
```

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

Configure Signal in `openclaw.config.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "account": "+15555550123",
      "cliPath": "signal-cli",
      "dmPolicy": "pairing",
      "allowFrom": []
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable Signal channel |
| `account` | string | - | Bot's phone number in E.164 format (e.g., `+15555550123`) |
| `cliPath` | string | `"signal-cli"` | Path to signal-cli binary |
| `dmPolicy` | string | `"pairing"` | DM access policy: `pairing`, `allowlist`, `open`, `disabled` |
| `allowFrom` | string[] | `[]` | Allowed sender identifiers (phone numbers or UUIDs) |

### DM Policies

- **`pairing`** (recommended): Unknown senders get a pairing code; approve with `openclaw pairing approve signal <identifier>`
- **`allowlist`**: Only senders in `allowFrom` can message
- **`open`**: Anyone can message (set `allowFrom: ["*"]`)
- **`disabled`**: Ignore all Signal DMs

### AllowFrom Formats

Signal supports two identifier formats:

**Phone numbers (E.164 format):**
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "allowFrom": ["+15555550123", "+447700900123"]
    }
  }
}
```

**UUIDs (Signal's internal identifier):**
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "allowFrom": [
        "uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
        "uuid:987fcdeb-51a2-43d3-b789-123456789abc"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

UUIDs are more reliable as they don't change when a user changes their phone number.

## Group Configuration

Signal groups work automatically once configured. To restrict access or settings per group:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "groups": {
        "group-id-base64": {
          "enabled": true,
          "requireMention": false,
          "allowFrom": ["+15555550123"],
          "toolPolicy": "allowlist"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get group IDs with:

```bash
signal-cli -a +15555550123 listGroups
```

## Media Handling

Signal supports:
- Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- Videos (MP4)
- Audio files
- Voice messages
- Documents

Media is automatically downloaded and processed.

## Reactions

Signal supports emoji reactions:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "reactions": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Multi-Account Support

You can configure multiple Signal accounts:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "accounts": {
        "personal": {
          "enabled": true,
          "account": "+15555550123",
          "allowFrom": ["+15555550456"]
        },
        "work": {
          "enabled": true,
          "account": "+15555550789",
          "allowFrom": ["+15555551234"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Each account must be registered separately with signal-cli.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="signal-cli not found">
    Ensure signal-cli is installed and in your PATH:

    ```bash
    which signal-cli
    ```

    If not found, either:
    1. Add signal-cli to your PATH
    2. Specify the full path in config:

    ```json
    {
      "channels": {
        "signal": {
          "cliPath": "/usr/local/bin/signal-cli"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Registration failed">
    Common issues:

    - **Number already registered**: Cannot use a number already registered to Signal
    - **Invalid number format**: Must be E.164 format (e.g., `+15555550123`)
    - **SMS not received**: Check phone number is correct and can receive SMS
    - **Rate limited**: Wait 24 hours before retrying

    For virtual numbers (e.g., Google Voice), Signal may reject registration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verification code invalid">
    - Ensure you're using the exact code from SMS (including dashes if present)
    - Code expires after 10 minutes - request a new one if expired
    - Don't add extra spaces or characters

    Request a new code:

    ```bash
    signal-cli -a +15555550123 register
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Messages not being received">
    Check status with probe:

    ```bash
    openclaw channels status --probe
    ```

    Common issues:
    - signal-cli daemon not running
    - Sender not in `allowFrom` (if using allowlist policy)
    - Check logs: `openclaw logs --follow | grep signal`

    Restart signal-cli:

    ```bash
    signal-cli -a +15555550123 daemon
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot send messages">
    Ensure recipient is registered with Signal:

    ```bash
    signal-cli -a +15555550123 getUserStatus +15555550456
    ```

    If not registered, you'll see an error. They must install Signal first.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Groups not working">
    Ensure:
    1. Bot is a member of the group
    2. Group ID is correctly configured
    3. Group policy allows messages

    List groups:

    ```bash
    signal-cli -a +15555550123 listGroups -d
    ```

    Join a group (if you have an invite link):

    ```bash
    signal-cli -a +15555550123 joinGroup --uri "https://signal.group/..."
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Linked device disconnected">
    If you linked as a secondary device and it disconnects:

    1. Unlink old device in Signal app
    2. Run `signal-cli link -n "OpenClaw"` again
    3. Scan new QR code

    Primary registration is more stable than linking.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Running signal-cli Daemon

For production use, run signal-cli as a daemon:

```bash
# Start daemon
signal-cli -a +15555550123 daemon

# Or as systemd service (Linux)
sudo systemctl start signal-cli
```

OpenClaw will communicate with the daemon via DBus (Linux) or direct socket (macOS).

## Security Considerations

- **End-to-end encryption** is maintained through signal-cli
- **Registration credentials** are stored in `~/.local/share/signal-cli/data/` by default
- **Backup credentials** regularly - you cannot recover them if lost
- **Use a dedicated number** - don't share with other services
- **Use allowlist mode** for production bots with known users

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Data Directory

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "dataDir": "/path/to/signal-cli/data"
    }
  }
}
```

### Daemon Socket Path

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "signal": {
      "socketPath": "/var/run/signal-cli/socket"
    }
  }
}
```
