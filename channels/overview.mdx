## Channel Configuration

All channels are configured in your `openclaw.config.json` under the `channels` section:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "botToken": "123456:ABC...",
      "dmPolicy": "pairing",
      "allowFrom": ["123456789"]
    },
    "discord": {
      "enabled": true,
      "token": "...",
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "guilds": {
        "guild-id": {
          "channels": {
            "channel-id": { "allow": true }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## DM Policies

Most channels support configurable DM (direct message) policies:

- **`pairing`** (default): Unknown senders receive a pairing code; you approve them
- **`allowlist`**: Only pre-approved senders can message
- **`open`**: Accept messages from anyone (requires `allowFrom: ["*"]`)
- **`disabled`**: Ignore all direct messages

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "dmPolicy": "pairing",
      "allowFrom": ["+15555550123"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Group Policies

Channels with group/channel support (Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp) use a `groupPolicy`:

- **`allowlist`**: Only specified channels/groups are monitored
- **`open`**: All channels the bot has access to
- **`disabled`**: No group monitoring

For Discord and Slack, configure specific channels:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "discord": {
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "guilds": {
        "123456789": {
          "channels": {
            "987654321": { "allow": true }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

The easiest way to set up channels is with the interactive onboarding:

```bash
openclaw init
```

This walks you through:
1. Selecting which channels to enable
2. Providing tokens/credentials
3. Configuring DM and group policies
4. Setting up allowlists

For manual setup, see each channel's dedicated page.

## Multi-Account Support

Most channels support multiple accounts. Configure them under `accounts`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "accounts": {
        "work": {
          "enabled": true,
          "botToken": "work-bot-token",
          "allowFrom": ["work-user-id"]
        },
        "personal": {
          "enabled": true,
          "botToken": "personal-bot-token",
          "allowFrom": ["personal-user-id"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The default account is identified by `"default"` or inferred from top-level configuration.

## Environment Variables

Most channels support environment variables as an alternative to config file storage:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram bot token
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Discord bot token
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - Slack bot token
- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` - Slack app-level token

Environment variables take precedence over config file values.

## Channel Status

Check channel status at any time:

```bash
openclaw channels status
```

For detailed diagnostics including connection probes:

```bash
openclaw channels status --probe
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use pairing mode** for channels you access from a personal device
2. **Use allowlist mode** for production bots with known users
3. **Never commit tokens** to version control - use environment variables or secure vaults
4. **Rotate tokens regularly** if they may have been exposed
5. **Review allowlists** periodically to remove stale entries
